# 0x00. Fix my code

This challenge involves fixing broken code in a series of C files and submitting the fixes through git commits. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in debugging, troubleshooting errors, and properly formatting code.

Each exercise contains C code that does not compile or execute properly. The task is to analyze the code, identify the issues, and correct the code so it functions as intended. This involves skills like:

- Carefully reading error messages and tracebacks to pinpoint bugs.
- Adding proper header files, libraries, and definitions.
- Fixing logic errors in algorithms and control flow.
- Correcting syntax issues and typos.
- Ensuring code adheres to style standards and best practices.

Solutions should be tested thoroughly to verify the code works correctly after fixes are applied. All corrections should be committed to git with clear commit messages explaining the changes made.

Completing these challenges requires patience, attention to detail, and tenacity in pursuing every issue until the code is fixed. With practice, debugging skills and an understanding of common errors will improve. The end result is code that runs properly and demonstrates programming abilities.
